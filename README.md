Suppose that we're working on a digital transformation for a big retailer. This retailer wants to serve its customers through an e-commerce and then send those clients to the nearest store to check for their bought product (size and specifications) or to withdraw the order.  But, to have those stores available and know its coverage area (to match which store attend that region), we need to register those areas in a database, and ensure that they're valid and working.  Later, the back-end team will implement an API which receives the user's geolocation and answers with the nearest store geolocation according to the coverage area and distance to the store geolocation.
